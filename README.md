# Comprehensive Guide: Instagram Recommendation Algorithm & A/B Testing Workflow

This guide explains, in clear theoretical terms, how Instagram selects and ranks Reels and Posts, and then how to design and interpret an A/B test comparing two feed strategies—without any code, just step-by-step logic and formulas.

## Part 1: Instagram’s Recommendation Algorithm

### 1. Business Goal  
Instagram’s primary objective is to maximize **user engagement** (likes, comments, shares, watch time). To achieve this, the system must predict, for each user and at each moment, which pieces of content they are most likely to engage with.

### 2. High-Level Architecture  
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Continuous collection of user actions (e.g., likes, comments, shares, watch completions) and content metadata (captions, hashtags, uploader info, timestamps).

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - **User Features:** Summaries of interaction history (e.g., counts and frequencies of likes, comments, watch time) and a vector representation (“embedding”) of interests derived from text (hashtags, captions) or past interactions.  
   - **Content Features:** Visual tags (detected objects/scenes via convolutional neural networks), audio characteristics (music trends, fingerprinting), text properties (hashtag frequencies, sentiment), and historical popularity metrics.

3. **Candidate Generation**  
   To keep latency low, the system uses approximate nearest-neighbor search over precomputed embeddings to quickly retrieve a manageable set of candidate posts for each user, then applies basic filters (e.g., policy compliance, language).

4. **Scoring & Ranking**  
   Each candidate is assigned a composite score using multiple sub-models:  
   - **Engagement Prediction Model:** Estimates the probability a user will like, comment, or watch in full (using logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, or shallow neural nets).  
   - **Collaborative Filtering:** Incorporates patterns of co-engagement among similar users or graph embeddings to boost items liked by like-minded users.  
   - **Sequence Modeling:** Uses transformer or recurrent architectures to account for the user’s recent session context.  
   - **Rescorers for Diversity & Freshness:** Apply heuristics to ensure variety (e.g., not too many posts from the same creator) and to boost newer content gently.

   An illustrative formula might be:  
   \[
     \text{FinalScore}
     = 0.5 \times P_{\text{engagement}}
       + 0.3 \times \text{RecencyScore}
       + 0.2 \times \text{PopularityScore}.
   \]

5. **Feed Assembly & Delivery**  
   The system sorts candidates by their final scores, enforces hard constraints (e.g., maximum posts per creator, demotion of flagged content), runs moderation checks, and delivers the top items (e.g., 20–50 posts or Reels) to the user’s feed or Reels tray.

## Part 2: A/B Testing Workflow for Feed Strategies

### Step 1: Define the Experiment  
- **Objective:** Compare two feed strategies on **engagement rate**, defined as  
  \[
    \text{engagement rate}
    = \frac{\text{likes} + \text{comments}}{\text{followers}}.
  \]  
- **Group A (Interest-Hashtag Feed):** Users receive posts tagged with one or more of the **top 20 globally frequent hashtags**, used as a proxy for interest-aligned content.  
- **Group B (Influencer Feed):** Users receive posts from verified accounts or accounts in the top 20% by follower count.  
- **Hypotheses:**  
  - *Null (H₀):* Mean engagement rate is equal between the two feeds.  
  - *Alternative (H₁):* Mean engagement rate differs (two-tailed).  
- **Significance Level:** α = 0.05.

### Step 2: Data Loading & Quality Checks  
1. **Missing-Value Audit:** Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column.  
2. **Column Decisions:**  
   - **Drop** columns with 100% missing data (no information).  
   - **Drop** non-critical columns with very high missingness (e.g., location if 77% missing and irrelevant).  
   - **Impute** moderately missing engagement fields (e.g., treat missing play counts as zero).  
   - **Fill** low-missing text fields with empty strings.  
   - **Drop rows** missing hashtags, since Group A relies on them.

### Step 3: Data Preparation  
- Convert the hashtag field from a text representation into a structured list so you can identify which posts contain the top 20 trending hashtags.  
- Ensure engagement-related fields (likes, comments, follower counts) are valid numbers, since you will use them in calculations.

### Step 4: Random Assignment to A/B Groups  
Assign each user impression randomly and equally to Group A or Group B. This ensures that, in expectation, both groups are similar in all respects except the feed strategy they experience.

### Step 5: Label Posts According to Strategy  
- **Influencer Flag (for Group B):** A post qualifies if it is from a verified account or the uploader’s follower count is in the top 20th percentile.  
- **Interest-Hashtag Flag (for Group A):** A post qualifies if any of its hashtags appear among the globally top-20 most frequent hashtags.

These flags let you isolate the subsets of posts served under each strategy.

### Step 6: Calculate Engagement Metrics  
For each post, define:  
\[
  \text{engagement} = \text{likes} + \text{comments},
  \quad
  \text{engagement rate} = \frac{\text{engagement}}{\text{followers}}.
\]  
This normalizes interaction volume by audience size, making comparisons fair across large and small accounts.

### Step 7: Statistical Analysis with Welch’s t-Test  
1. **Compute Sample Means (\(\bar{x}_A, \bar{x}_B\)):** The average engagement rate in each group.  
2. **Compute Sample Variances (\(s_A^2, s_B^2\)):** Measures of how spread out engagement rates are within each group, using the formula  
   \[
     s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}.
   \]  
3. **Welch t-Statistic:**  
   \[
     t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}
              {\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}}.
   \]  
   This quantifies how many “standard-error units” the two means differ by.  
4. **Degrees of Freedom (df):** Using the Welch–Satterthwaite approximation,  
   \[
     df = 
     \frac{\bigl(\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}\bigr)^2}
          {\frac{(s_A^2 / n_A)^2}{n_A - 1}
          + \frac{(s_B^2 / n_B)^2}{n_B - 1}}.
   \]  
   This df adjusts the t-distribution shape to account for unequal variances and sample sizes.  
5. **p-Value (Two-Tailed):**  
   - Find the tail probability beyond \(\lvert t\rvert\) under a t-distribution with \(df\).  
   - Double that probability to cover both positive and negative extremes.

### Step 8: Decision Rule  
- If the resulting **p-value** ≤ 0.05, you **reject the null hypothesis**, concluding that the difference in engagement rates is statistically significant.  
- The **sign** of \(t\) tells you which group performed better: a positive \(t\) means Group A’s mean exceeds Group B’s.

### Step 9: Visualization & Business Interpretation  
- **Boxplots** or **violin plots** of engagement rates by group visually confirm differences in distribution.  
- Report summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample size) for each group.  
- Translate results into product recommendations: if Group A shows a statistically significant higher engagement rate (e.g., \(p\approx 0.013\)), Instagram should prioritize the **Interest-Hashtag Feed**.

**Conclusion:** By following this theoretical framework—defining hypotheses, preparing data, labeling cohorts, computing normalized engagement metrics, and applying a rigorous statistical test—you can confidently determine which feed strategy best drives user engagement, with clear formulas and decision criteria at each step.
